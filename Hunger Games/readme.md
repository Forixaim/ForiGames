# ForiGames
A hobby project that was formed when I saw Hunger Games Simulator, then many popped up with each made in PHP, or MySQL.

I've Decided to take a very different approach, and made it in C++.

Currently there is only death and kill... nothing much else yet. 

There will be funny stories, jokes, day/night cycles, and more.

## How to use
1. Download the latest release
2. Extract the zip file
3. Run the exe file.
4. Enjoy!
